            <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch painter, generally considered to be the greatest after Rembrandt van Rijn, 
              and one of the greatest of the Post-Impressionists. He sold only one artwork during his life, 
              but in the century after his death he became perhaps the most recognized painter of all time.
